# Data Science Education in 2020

This repo contains the original Keynote file and derived PDF and PPTX files for the talk I gave at rstudio::conf(2020) on *Data Science Education in 2020".

Quick summary: Data science faces 3 big challenges in the next two years:

1. A data explosion
2. The reproducibility crisis
3. Increasing instances of fake data

The solutions are not rocket science and in fact, are pretty obvious even today. However, key to every trend is our ability to act on the obvious before everyone else does. The solutions are:

1. (Re-)embracing statistics
2. Creating computational documents we can run as well as read
3. Democratizing data science to experts who understand what the data means.
