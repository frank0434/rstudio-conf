## Introduction to Data Science in the Tidyverse

#### Amelia McNamara and Hadley Wickham

This is a two-day hands on workshop based on the book “R for Data Science”. You will learn how to visualize, transform, and model data in R and work with date-times, character strings, and untidy data formats. Along the way, you will learn and use many packages from the tidyverse including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, lubridate, and forcats.

You should take this course if you are newer to R and want to establish good habits or have some experience and simply want to learn the tidiest ways to use R.

This course is led by friend of RStudio, Amelia McNamara, from the Department of Computer & Information Sciences at the University of St, Thomas, and Hadley Wickham, RStudio Chief Scientist and co-author of the book R for Data Science.

## Building Tidy Tools

#### Charlotte Wickham and Hadley Wickham 

This is a two-day hands on workshop for those who have embraced the tidyverse and now want to expand it to meet their own needs. We'll discuss API design, functional programming tools, the basics of object design in S3, and the tidy eval system for NSE.

Learn efficient workflows for developing high-quality R functions, using the set of conventions codified by a package. You'll also learn workflows for unit testing, which helps ensure that your functions do exactly what you think they do.
Master the art of writing functions that do one thing well and can be fluently combined together to solve more complex problems.We'll cover common function writing pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Learn how to write collections of functions that work well together, and adhere to existing conventions so they're easy to pick up for newcomers.

You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to tackle larger scale problems. You'll get the most from it if you're already familiar with functions and are comfortable with R’s basic data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames). Note: There is ~30% overlap in the material with Hadley’s previous "R Masterclass". However, the material has been substantially reorganized, so if you've taken the R Masterclass in the past, you'll still learn a lot in this class.

This course is led by friend of RStudio, Charlotte Wickham, a professor and award winning teacher and data analyst at Oregon State University, and co-taught by her brother Hadley, who works at RStudio.

More info and materials can be found [here](https://rstd.io/tidytools19).


## What They Forgot to Teach You About R

#### Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester

This is a two-day hands on workshop designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. You’ll learn holistic workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis. We’ll work on project-oriented workflows, version control for data science (Git/GitHub!), and how to plan for collaboration, communication, and iteration (incl. RMarkdown). In terms of your R skills, expect to come away with new knowledge of your R installation, how to maintain it, robust strategies for working with the file system, and ways to use the purrr package for repetitive tasks.

You should take this workshop if you’ve been using R for a while and you feel like writing R code is not what’s holding you back the most. You’ve realized that you have more pressing “meta” problems that no one seems to talk about: how to divide your work into projects and scripts, how to expose your work to others, and how to get more connected to the R development scene. The tidyverse is not an explicit focus of the course (other than the purrr segment) and you can certainly work through the content without it. But you should expect a great deal of tidyverse exposure.

This course is taught by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.

Jenny is a Software Engineer and Data Scientist at RStudio and Adjunct Professor of Statistics at the University of British Columbia. Jenny is widely hailed for making Github a catalyst rather than an impediment to R happiness.

Jim is a software engineer on the tidyverse team at RStudio, with a background in Bioinformatics and Genomics. He is the author and maintainer of a number of R packages including covr, devtools, glue, readr, and more.

## Intro to Shiny and R Markdown

#### Danny Kaplan

This is a two-day, hands-on workshop for people who know their way around the RStudio IDE and R and are now looking for the most effective way to become proficient in the basics of Shiny application development and using R Markdown to communicate insights from data analysis to others.

You should take this course if you have used R and RStudio but don’t know as much as you’d like about Shiny and R Markdown. This workshop will reveal the amazing universe of what’s possible with Shiny and R Markdown and let you practice what you’ve learned.

This workshop is led by Danny Kaplan, a highly regarded educator at Macalester College, long-time friend of RStudio, and author of several textbooks on data science, statistical modeling and computing, and even chaos theory.

More info and materials can be found [here](https://github.com/dtkaplan/shinymar).


## Advanced R Markdown

#### Alison Hill and Yihui Xie

This is a two-day hands on workshop based on the book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide. This workshop is designed for those who want to take their R Markdown skills to the next level. We'll talk about many low-level details in the rmarkdown package and the whole R Markdown ecosystem. The two goals of this workshop are: 1) learn how to fully customize R Markdown output (HTML, LaTeX/PDF, Word, and PowerPoint); and 2) learn more about existing R Markdown extensions in the ecosystem, such as flexdashboard, bookdown, blogdown, pkgdown, xaringan, rticles, and learnr. We will also talk about how to use or develop new language engines (languages that are not R), how to develop HTML widgets, and integrate Shiny with R Markdown.

You should take this workshop if you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to take advantage of the amazing breadth and depth of R Markdown. You'll get the most from it if you enjoy learning how R Markdown works under the hood (which will involve reading some source code), and are seriously interested in hacking (playing) with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, LaTeX, and command-line tools. We will give minimal tutorials on these languages and tools in the workshop, but it may be easier for you to keep pace with the instructor if you already know them before.

This workshop is led by Yihui Xie, Software Engineer and Data Scientist at RStudio. Yihui is the main author of the open-source knitr package for reproducible research and dynamic report generation. He has also created and co-authored several other R packages, including rmarkdown, bookdown, blogdown, xaringan, tinytex, DT, shiny, and leaflet. He has authored and co-authored four books: Dynamic Documents with R and knitr, bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown, blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown, and R Markdown: The Definitive Guide.

## Intermediate Shiny

#### Aimee Gott and Winston Chang

This two-day workshop is designed by Shiny author Joe Cheng for the experienced Shiny developer. By taking this workshop, you’ll improve your understanding of shiny’s foundations and learn how to make the most of reactive programming, techniques for extending and improving UI, techniques for debugging and tools for modularizing applications. By the end of the two days, you’ll be able to push the envelope of what you and your organizations can do with Shiny.

You should take this workshop if you are already familiar with the basics of shiny and you have built your own simple applications.

This course is led by friend of RStudio and Education Practice Lead at RStudio Certified Partner Mango Solutions, Aimee Gott. Winston Chang, RStudio Data Scientist, Developer, and author of the R Graphics Cookbook will join Aimee to provide hands on advice and answers to the Shiny application development questions that stump you.

## Using Shiny in Production

#### Kelly O'Briant and Sean Lopp

This two-day workshop will teach you the best practices that make production-quality Shiny application performance possible. Does 30,000 simultaneous users for a Shiny application sound challenging? Shiny is used all over the world to deliver interactive, visual data products from data science teams to internal and external audiences at scale. The course will not spend time on writing applications, but will focus on the open source and professional ecosystem around shiny that includes performance optimization, testing, and production deployment. This workshop relies on RStudio professional products for deployment.

You should take this workshop if you are comfortable writing Shiny apps but are afraid for what will happen when people start looking at them.

The workshop is taught by Sean Lopp, RStudio Solutions Engineer. Sean works with RStudio product teams and helps enterprise customers to realize the value of R and Shiny.
